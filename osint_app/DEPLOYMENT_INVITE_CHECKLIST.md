# Deployment Checklist for Invite System

## Critical Fix Applied

The main issue was that the landing page (`/`) was not included in the `inviteProtectedPaths` array in the middleware. This caused the following problem:

1. User enters valid invite code
2. Gets redirected to `/`
3. Middleware checks `/` and doesn't find it in public or invite-protected paths
4. Middleware requires full authentication for `/`
5. User gets redirected to `/login` or receives an error

**Fix Applied**: Added `/` to the `inviteProtectedPaths` array so it's accessible after invite verification but before signup.

## Deployment Verification Steps

1. **Clear Browser Data**
   - Clear all cookies for the domain
   - Clear browser cache
   - Try in incognito/private mode

2. **Test Flow**
   ```
   1. Visit https://osint-app-jet.vercel.app/
   2. Should redirect to /invite
   3. Enter valid invite code
   4. Should redirect to landing page (/)
   5. Should see welcome banner
   6. Can click "Sign Up" to create account
   ```

3. **Check Vercel Logs**
   - Look for any middleware errors
   - Check for redirect loops
   - Verify cookie setting/reading

4. **Common Issues & Solutions**

   **Issue**: ERR_FAILED after invite verification
   - **Cause**: Middleware redirect loop or missing path configuration
   - **Solution**: Fixed by adding `/` to inviteProtectedPaths

   **Issue**: Cookies not persisting
   - **Cause**: Secure cookie settings in production
   - **Solution**: Cookies are set with `secure: true` in production, ensure HTTPS

   **Issue**: Infinite redirects
   - **Cause**: Path not properly categorized in middleware
   - **Solution**: Ensure all paths are in correct arrays (public, invite-protected, or require auth)

## Environment Variables to Verify

```env
JWT_SECRET=<secure-random-string>
NODE_ENV=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://osint-app-jet.vercel.app
```

## Quick Debug Commands

If issues persist, add these debug logs to middleware:

```typescript
console.log('Middleware Debug:', {
  pathname,
  hasInviteVerified: !!inviteVerified,
  isPublicPath,
  isInviteProtectedPath
});
```

## Rollback Plan

If the issue persists after deployment:
1. Temporarily add `/` to `publicPaths` to allow access
2. Debug the cookie flow
3. Check Vercel function logs for errors
