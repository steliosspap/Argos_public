# Media Bias Analysis Feature - ARCHIVED

**Date Archived**: January 16, 2025  
**Reason**: Feature was experimental and not required for production

## Overview

This directory contains the complete implementation of the media bias detection and news corroboration system for Argos Intelligence Center. The feature was fully functional but has been archived as it was deemed unnecessary for the current product requirements.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Modules
- **BiasDetector** (`bias-detection/bias-detector.ts`) - Detected political bias using rule-based and LLM approaches
- **FactChecker** (`corroboration/fact-checker.ts`) - Verified claims across multiple sources
- **MultiLanguageAnalyzer** (`translation/multi-language-analyzer.ts`) - Handled 20+ languages
- **AnalysisPipeline** (`analysis-pipeline.ts`) - Orchestrated the entire analysis process

### 2. UI Components
- **BiasMeter** - Visual bias indicator with gradient
- **VerificationBadge** - Fact-check status display
- **CompactBiasIndicator** - Inline badges for lists

### 3. API Endpoints
- `/api/analyze-visible` - Batch analysis endpoint
- `/test-bias` - Test page demonstrating all components

### 4. Database Schema
The following tables/columns were added:
- `bias_analyses` table
- `fact_check_results` table
- Columns in `news` and `events` tables:
  - `bias_analysis_id`
  - `bias_score` 
  - `verification_status`
  - `has_analysis`

### 5. Scripts
Various analysis and testing scripts in the `scripts/` directory

## Status When Archived

- 21 events had been analyzed with bias scores
- 18 news items had been analyzed
- The system was functional but causing API errors due to auto-analysis hooks

## How to Restore

If you need to restore this feature:

1. Move all files back to their original locations:
   - `bias-detection/` → `src/lib/bias-detection/`
   - `corroboration/` → `src/lib/corroboration/`
   - `translation/` → `src/lib/translation/`
   - `analysis/` → `src/components/analysis/`
   - etc.

2. Restore imports in:
   - `src/components/intelligence/ConflictDashboard.tsx`
   - `src/app/intelligence-center/page.tsx`

3. Ensure environment variables are set:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - `GOOGLE_CUSTOM_SEARCH_API_KEY`
   - `GOOGLE_CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID`

4. The database schema is still in place, so no migrations needed

## Notes

- The feature was working correctly when archived
- All analyzed data remains in the database
- The UI no longer displays bias indicators
- API endpoints have been removed from active routes
