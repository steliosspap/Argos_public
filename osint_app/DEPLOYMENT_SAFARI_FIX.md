# Safari Compatibility Fixes - Deployment Checklist

## Issues Fixed

1. **Notification Permission Error**
   - Removed automatic notification permission requests
   - Added manual `setupPushNotifications()` function that requires user interaction
   - Disabled push notifications by default in service worker registration

2. **Multiple GoTrueClient Instances**
   - Centralized Supabase client usage in `/lib/supabase.ts`
   - Updated hooks to use the centralized client instead of creating new instances

3. **500 Errors on API Routes**
   - Added CORS middleware for Safari compatibility
   - Improved error handling and logging in API routes
   - Added null checks for Supabase client initialization

4. **Safari Storage Issues**
   - Created Safari-compatible storage utility (`/utils/storage.ts`)
   - Updated AuthContext to use the new storage utility
   - Fixed inconsistent token key usage

## Deployment Steps

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Ensure all environment variables are set in production:
     ```
     NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
     NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
     SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (if using server-side features)
     JWT_SECRET
     ```

2. **Clear Browser Cache**
   - After deployment, users should clear their browser cache or use hard refresh
   - Service worker cache should be invalidated

3. **Build and Deploy**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run start
   ```

4. **Verify in Safari**
   - Test on Safari desktop and iOS Safari
   - Check console for any remaining errors
   - Verify that notification permissions are not requested automatically
   - Confirm API endpoints are returning data properly

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Intelligence center loads without errors in Safari
- [ ] No notification permission prompts on page load
- [ ] API endpoints return data (news, events, arms deals)
- [ ] Authentication works properly (login, token storage)
- [ ] No "Multiple GoTrueClient instances" warnings in console
- [ ] Service worker registers successfully without errors

## Rollback Plan

If issues persist:
1. Disable service worker temporarily by commenting out registration in `ServiceWorkerProvider.tsx`
2. Check server logs for any Supabase connection errors
3. Verify environment variables are correctly set in production
